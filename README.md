Task 7 of the AI & ML Internship, which focuses on implementing and evaluating Support Vector Machines (SVM) for both linear and non-linear classification problems.

üéØ Objective
The primary goal was to gain practical experience using SVMs for classification by comparing different kernels and optimizing hyperparameters. This task also covered learning about margin maximization, the kernel trick, and hyperparameter tuning.



üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following tools and Python libraries:

Scikit-learn (sklearn): For the SVC (Support Vector Classifier), data processing, cross-validation, and performance evaluation.

NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For visualizing the decision boundaries.

üìù Implementation Steps
The solution followed these steps as outlined in the mini-guide:


Dataset Preparation: Loaded and prepared a dataset suitable for binary classification (e.g., the Breast Cancer Dataset).



Model Training: Trained and compared two SVM models using the linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels.


Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized crucial hyperparameters, including C and gamma, to find the best model settings.


Evaluation: The tuned model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation to ensure robust results.


Visualization: The decision boundary of the final, optimized SVM model was plotted using 2D data.

üß† Key Concepts Covered
This task provided hands-on experience with fundamental SVM concepts:


Margin Maximization: Understanding how SVM seeks the optimal hyperplane with the largest margin.


Kernel Trick: Grasping the mechanism by which kernels (like RBF) handle non-linearly separable data.


Hyperparameter Tuning: The effects of the C parameter and Œ≥ on model performance.
